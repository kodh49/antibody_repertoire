# Clonal Lineage Analysis of Antibody Repertoire Seq Data
This repository offers a codebase for comprehensive examination of the clonal lineage analysis of antibody repertoire sequencing data obtained post-seasonal influenza vaccination. The attached report discusses the rationale and computational framework under each phase of antibody repertoire sequencing data analysis and analyzes the findings of the experiment. Germline V, D, and J gene alignments to the antibody repertoire sequencing data were identified, and the CDR3 antigen-binding region for each query sequence was delineated using the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)'s IgBLAST software. Subsequently, the clonal lineage was deduced by evaluating the connected components of the Hamming graph constructed from this IgBLAST analysis. All computational processes for the analysis were executed on the Cedar heterogeneous cluster at Simon Fraser University as part of the Advanced Research Computing service provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada.
